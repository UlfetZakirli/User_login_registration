***Node.js*** is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally

***Express.js*** is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application.

It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.

***Jwt*** JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

***MongoDB*** is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL) which is deemed non-free by several distributions. MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance.

***Joi*** is a code validation for Node.js and Express.

***Mongoose-unique-validator*** is a plugin which adds pre-save validation for unique fields within a Mongoose schema.

***Bcrypt.js*** is a library to help you hash passwords. Optimized bcrypt in plain JavaScript with zero dependencies.
